	<p class= "vacuums">Vacuums are a common appliance used today by millions of people. They pick up dust and debris from within almost all surfaces.</p>

		<p class= "how-do-vacuums-work">How do Vacuums Work?</p>

		<p class= "how-vacuums-work">The electricity outlet supplies the energy to the vacuum's electric motor. The fan attached to the electric motor sucks air, brushes on the bottom of the unit loosen dirt by spinning and loosened dirt is picked up and moved through the front of the machine. Dirty air travels through to the back of the machine, cooling the electric motor as it passes by. Dirt is transported to a collection area, like a vacuum bag or detachable compartment by the means of air current. The exhaust air goes through various filters to remove it of contaminants like allergens. This is very helpful for people with allergies and helps keep the air in your home relatively clean, and this air emerges out of the back. The outgoing air is much warmer than the incoming air becuase it's picked up heat from the elecric motor.</p>

		<p class= "dc-motors">DC Motors</p>

		<p class= "dc-motors-info">In a DC motor, there are permanent magnets on the outside and a spinning armature on the inside. The permanent magnets are stationary, so they are called the stator. The armature rotates, so it is called the rotor. The armature contains an electromagnet. When you run electricity into this electromagnet, it creates a magnetic field in the armature that attracts and repels the magnets in the stator. So the armature spins through 180 degrees. To keep it spinning, you have to change the poles of the electromagnet. The brushes handle this change in polarity. They make contact with two spinning electrodes attached to the armature and flip the magnetic polarity of the electromagnet as it spins.</p>

		<!-- Radios -->
		
		<a name="about-radios"></a>

		<p class= "about-radios">About Radios</p>

		<p class= "about-radioss">A radio is used to recieve audio signals, so we can listen to music, news, or communicate etc.</p>

		<p class= "how-radios-work">How Radios Work</p>

		<p class="how-a-radio-works">You use microphones to capture the sounds of people's voices and turn them into electrical energy. You take that electricity and, make it flow along a tall metal antenna. As the electrons in the electric current wiggle back and forth along the antenna, they create invisible electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves. These waves travel out at the speed of light, taking your radio program with them. What happens when I turn on my radio in my home a few miles away? The radio waves you sent flow through the metal antenna and cause electrons to wiggle back and forth. That generates an electric currentâ€”a signal that the electronic components inside my radio turn back into sound I can hear. The radio recieves elctromagneticwaves from the air that are sent by a radio transmitte. A radio catches radio waves, a bit like a baseball catcher's mitt. These waves are then coverted to sound energy and played on the radio's speakers.</p>

		<p class= "cassette-player">Cassette Player</p>

		<p class= "cassette-player-info">The cassette tape consists of two spools seated inside a hollow plastic casing. Between these spools is wound a length of flat plastic tape which is coated with a layer of ferric oxide, a metal substance which, once magnetized, remains that way for the rest of its life. These mechanisms are protected by a plastic outer case. The player takes the electromagnetic signals from the cassette and converts them into amplified audio sound. The electromagnetic recording on the oxide coating transmits electrical signals rather than receiving them.
